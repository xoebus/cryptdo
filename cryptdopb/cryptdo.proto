  //
  // # Version 1
  //
  // The first version of the cryptdo encryption used PBKDF2 to generate a key
  // from the user's passphrase which is then used with AES-GCM to encrypt the
  // plain text.
  //
  // The key is derived using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA384 using 100,000 iterations using
  // a random 32 byte salt. This salt is stored in the salt field (tag 2)
  // below.
  //
  // The encryption is performed by using AES in GCM mode. This uses a random
  // 12 byte nonce which is then stored in the nonce field (tag 3) below. The
  // finished ciphertext is then stored in the ciphertext field (tag 4) below.
  //
  // Notes:
  //
  // 1) SHA384 is used in the key derivation because of the proliferation of
  //    specialized hardware to attack SHA256 due to its use in Bitcoin.
  //
  // 2) The encryption key (derived from the user's passphrase) must be rotated
  //    before 2^32 encryptions have taken place with a single key. Due to the
  //    usage patterns of a tool like this it is unlikely that this limit will
  //    be reached. However, you should bear this in mind before using the same
  //    cryptographic primitives in your software.
